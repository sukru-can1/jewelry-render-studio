# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-05)

**Core value:** An operator can take one jewelry model and reliably produce the full set of catalog images — every angle × metal × stone variant, in correctly separated metal/stone layers — without touching Blender or hand-editing recipes.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Secure Foundation (Secrets + DB + Auth)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Secure Foundation: Secrets + DB + Auth)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-05 — Roadmap created (8 phases, 41 requirements mapped, 100% coverage)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Reuse the proven RunPod + Blender + `lib/enterprise-recipes.ts` + `lib/runpod.ts` pipeline; build only the product layer (auth, Postgres, builder, orchestration, outputs, compositing).
- Phase 1: Security pre-work (rotate leaked RunPod key), pooled Prisma topology (`connection_limit=1` + singleton + `directUrl`), and the `JobStatus` enum are day-one decisions — expensive to retrofit.
- Phase 3: Batch cost guardrails (live count/estimate, hard cap, preview-quality default, confirmation) MUST ship with the builder, not after.
- Phase 4: Status via RunPod webhook (primary) + Vercel Cron reconcile (fallback + retry driver); never poll RunPod on user page loads.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- SEC-01 (rotate exposed RunPod key) is a hard prerequisite — all downstream auth is moot until it ships in Phase 1.
- Cost-estimate accuracy (Phase 3) needs calibration against real RunPod billing; use a configurable per-render cost factor.
- Vercel sub-daily Cron is a Pro-plan feature (Phase 4) — confirm plan at plan time; fallback is an external scheduler or kick-on-stale-page-load.
- Legacy public-Blob asset policy (re-upload private vs. accept burned) to resolve in Phase 1/8.
